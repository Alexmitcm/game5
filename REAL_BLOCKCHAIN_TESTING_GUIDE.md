# Real Blockchain Integration Testing Guide

## üéØ What's Fixed

The admin panel now connects to **real smart contracts** on **Arbitrum One** instead of using mock data:

‚úÖ **Real Contract Addresses**: Using actual deployed contract addresses  
‚úÖ **Arbitrum One Network**: Properly configured for Arbitrum One (Chain ID: 42161)  
‚úÖ **Real Wallet Integration**: Direct blockchain interaction via wagmi/viem  
‚úÖ **Network Validation**: Ensures you're connected to the correct network  
‚úÖ **Transaction Signing**: Real transactions that require wallet approval  

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Navigate to `http://localhost:4784/admin`
2. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask, WalletConnect, or injected wallet
3. **Switch to Arbitrum One**: The panel will prompt you to switch networks
4. **Verify Admin Role**: Ensure your wallet has admin privileges on the contracts

## üîó Contract Addresses (Arbitrum One)

REFERRAL: "0x3bC03e9793d2E67298fb30871a08050414757Ca7"

## üîç Verification Steps

### Transaction Verification
1. **MetaMask Popup**: Should appear for every write operation
2. **Transaction Hash**: Copy and verify on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io)
3. **Gas Fees**: Confirm you have sufficient ETH for gas
4. **Network**: Ensure you're on Arbitrum One (Chain ID: 42161)

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ MetaMask popup appears for transactions
- ‚úÖ Transaction hash is generated
- ‚úÖ Transaction confirms on Arbitrum One
- ‚úÖ Toast notification shows success
- ‚úÖ Contract state changes on blockchain

### Error Indicators
- ‚ùå "User rejected transaction" (user cancelled)
- ‚ùå "Insufficient funds" (need more ETH for gas)
- ‚ùå "Contract not found" (wrong network)
- ‚ùå "Access denied" (no admin role)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Contract not found"
**Solution**: Ensure you're connected to Arbitrum One (Chain ID: 42161)

### Issue: "Access denied"
**Solution**: Verify your wallet has admin role on the contracts

### Issue: "Insufficient funds"
**Solution**: Add ETH to your wallet for gas fees

### Issue: "User rejected transaction"
**Solution**: User cancelled the transaction in MetaMask

### Issue: "Network not supported"
**Solution**: Add Arbitrum One to MetaMask:
- Network Name: Arbitrum One
- RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
- Chain ID: 42161
- Currency Symbol: ETH

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Real Money**: These are real transactions on Arbitrum One
2. **Gas Fees**: Each transaction requires ETH for gas
3. **Admin Role**: Only wallets with admin privileges can execute functions
4. **Network**: Must be connected to Arbitrum One (not testnet)
5. **Backup**: Keep records of all transaction hashes
