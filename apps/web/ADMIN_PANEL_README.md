# Smart Contract Control Panel

A professional, high-utility admin interface for managing blockchain smart contracts. This panel provides direct on-chain interaction capabilities for both referral and game vault contracts.

## üöÄ Features

### Referral Contract Management
- **Registration & Fee Management**: Configure registration costs, fee percentages, and payment limits
- **Vault Fund Distribution**: Set how incoming funds are distributed across different vaults
- **Reward Calculation**: Trigger reward calculation processes
- **Unbalanced Reward Calculation**: Process unbalanced reward calculations

### Game Vault Contract Management
- **Batch Reward Distribution**: Distribute rewards to multiple players at once
- **Batch Claim Rewards**: Claim rewards on behalf of multiple players
- **Player Balance Monitoring**: Check individual player balances

### Access Control Management
- **Role Management**: Grant and revoke administrative roles for both contracts
- **Multi-Contract Support**: Manage roles for referral and game vault contracts separately
- **Security Features**: Confirmation modals for critical actions

### Data Monitoring
- **Player Node Data**: View detailed player node information from referral contract
- **Unbalanced Node Data**: Monitor unbalanced player nodes
- **Balance Queries**: Check player balances in game vault contract
- **Real-time Data**: Direct blockchain queries for up-to-date information

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

### 1. Contract Addresses
Update the contract addresses in `src/lib/contracts.ts`:

```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  REFERRAL: "0x...", // Your deployed referral contract address
  GAME_VAULT: "0x...", // Your deployed game vault contract address
  TETHER: "0x..." // Your deployed tether contract address
} as const;
```

### 2. Network Configuration
Configure your network settings in `src/lib/contracts.ts`:

```typescript
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  CHAIN_ID: 1, // Your target network chain ID
  RPC_URL: "https://your-rpc-url", // Your RPC endpoint
  EXPLORER_URL: "https://your-explorer-url" // Your block explorer
} as const;
```

### 3. Running the Admin Panel

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Run the main application on port 4783
npm run dev

# Run the admin panel on port 4784
npm run dev:admin
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the main application
npm run start

# Start the admin panel
npm run start:admin
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Access Control
- The admin panel requires wallet connection
- Only addresses with appropriate roles can execute administrative functions
- All critical actions require confirmation

### Role Management
- **Default Admin Role**: Full administrative access
- **Keeper Role**: Limited administrative access
- Roles can be granted and revoked through the interface

### Transaction Safety
- All transactions require wallet signature
- Confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Input validation for all parameters

### Contract Integration
- ABI files: `src/abi/referral.json`, `src/abi/gameVault.json`
- Contract addresses: `src/lib/contracts.ts`
- Network configuration: `src/lib/contracts.ts`

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Contract Addresses**: Always verify contract addresses before deployment
2. **Role Permissions**: Ensure your wallet has the necessary roles
3. **Network Selection**: Make sure you're connected to the correct network
4. **Gas Fees**: Be aware of gas costs for transactions
5. **Testing**: Test all functions on testnet before mainnet

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to execute transaction"**
   - Check wallet connection
   - Verify network selection
   - Ensure sufficient gas fees
   - Confirm role permissions

2. **"Invalid address"**
   - Verify address format (0x...)
   - Check for typos
   - Ensure address is on correct network

3. **"Insufficient permissions"**
   - Check if wallet has required roles
   - Verify contract ownership
   - Contact contract administrator
